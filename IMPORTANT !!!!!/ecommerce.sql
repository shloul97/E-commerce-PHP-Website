The use of sunscreen with high protection index - SPF50 - during the treatment is key to ensure its effectiveness and avoid the hyperpigmentation stimulation.Other considerations:In the case of an intensive depigmenting treatment, the use of the Dermamelan is totally contra-indicated in the summer, therefore it should start in seasons where sun exposure is lower. Using the Dermamelan, severe flaking may occur in the first and second weeks, there may be stinging, redness, tenderness to the touch and periorbital edema. With continued use, in wich the cell renewal is normalized, these reactions tend to fade away, although it does not diminish in any way the effectiveness of the product or the depigmenting effect.The first results of the treatment should be obtained 21 to 30 days after the treatment\'s initiation.The continued treatment with Cosmelan develops skin resistance to the treatment.', 2, 1, 3, 234.18, 0, '30ML', NULL, 0),
